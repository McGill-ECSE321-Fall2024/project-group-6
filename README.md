Main scope of the project : 
The main scope of the project is developing a web application for an independent game shop with three main user types: owner, employees and customers. 

Store Management Features:
The owner and employees can manage the product catalogue by adding, updating, and removing games.
Games must be categorised, and employees can only publish games after the owner approves.
The owner requires an administrative dashboard to oversee employee management, review customer order history, respond to reviews, and update store details (e.g., policies, promotions).
Customer Features:
Customers can browse games, create accounts, purchase games, track their order history, save items to wish lists, and post reviews of purchased games.

Our web application must support the scenarios described for every stakeholder. All functionality of the system needs to be accessible via the web frontend for respective stakeholders.

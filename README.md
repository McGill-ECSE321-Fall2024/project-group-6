Introduction to the team : <br/>
We are a team of 6 engineering students coming from various backgrounds. 
Marine Dupuy is a U4 chemical engineering student who is doing a minor in software engineering. 
Maissa Mehdi is a U4 chemical engineering student who is also doing a minor in software engineering. 
Mario Ghorayeb is a U3 computer engineering student.

Main scope of the project : <br/>
The main scope of the project is developing a web application for an independent game shop with three main user types: owner, employees and customers. 

Store Management Features: <br/>
The owner and employees can manage the product catalogue by adding, updating, and removing games.
Games must be categorised, and employees can only publish games after the owner approves.
The owner requires an administrative dashboard to oversee employee management, review customer order history, respond to reviews, and update store details (e.g., policies, promotions).
Customer Features:
Customers can browse games, create accounts, purchase games, track their order history, save items to wish lists, and post reviews of purchased games.

Our web application must support the scenarios described for every stakeholder. All functionality of the system needs to be accessible via the web frontend for respective stakeholders.
To run the tests:
1) Clone repository
2) Go to the resources folder and open the application.properties document.
3) You can either create a database with the specified name on the specified port or change the properties any way that suits you.
